### Purpose
This Report was mainly to showcase Revenues / Profits quaterly and yearly for a pizza place. Indentifying trends and relaying insights to a "Non Technical" department was the major goal of this report.

### Concepts Used
Analysis and Data Cleaning was mostly doing on Power Bi, using both DAX formulas & Power Query Tool to transform Data into it's intended format to be used for visualization.

### Data Modeling (SnowFlake Schema)
Dividing tables into numerous Dimension tables made it an easier process to perform calculations. The decision to operate the model using a Snowflake Schema was due to the fact, that we needed to create a hierarchy of importance within the columns and metrics , unlike star schema which didn't provide me a solution to creating an unequal hierarchy.

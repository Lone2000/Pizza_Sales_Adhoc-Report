### Purpose
This Report was mainly to showcase Revenues / Profits quaterly and yearly for a pizza place. Indentifying trends and relaying insights to a "Non Technical" department was the major goal of this report.

### Concepts Used
Analysis and Data Cleaning was mostly doing on Power Bi, using both DAX formulas & Power Query Tool to transform Data into it's intended format to be used for visualization.

### Data Modeling (Star Schema)
Dividing tables into Fact's & Dim Table made it an easier process to perform calculations. The decision to operate the model using a Star Schema was due to the fact, Star Schema worked best for this dataset, unlike Snowflake scheme which is better more larger datasets.
